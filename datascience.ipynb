              "10   About the Position\\n\\n\\nAt Jane Street, we consider trading and programming to be two ends of a continuum. As both a trading firm and a tech firm, we have room for people who love to trade, people who love to program, and people everywhere in between. Nearly all of our traders write code, and many of our developers trade. The role you carve out for yourself will be largely dependent on your strengths and the types of problems you enjoy thinking about.\\n\\nResearchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of the trading and software developer roles, this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.\\n\\nAbout You\\nBe able to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems. Asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers.\\nWrite great code. We mostly write in OCaml, so you should want to learn functional programming if you don't already have experience with it.\\nHave good taste in research.The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers. You should be comfortable pushing in new and unknown directions while maintaining clarity of purpose.\\nThink and communicate precisely and openly. We believe great solutions come from the interaction between diverse groups of people across the firm.

The individual in this role will remediate (hands on) the platform/script related issues, act as SME for the consumption tools. An ideal candidate will have experience on configuration, performance tuning, user setup and onboarding in the tool set. The candidate should have excellent communication skills and able to drive some of the discussion with JPMIS, Vendor GTI partners on tool configuration, installation and performance tuning.\\n\\nPreferred Qualifications:\\n10+ years of hands on experience on data solutions – DW/BI, Data Architecture, Database, Data Security\\n2+ years of experience in any one of Hortonworks/Cloudera/MapR\\nFamiliarity with some of the data consumption tool/database (Hive, Impala, EsGyn, Trifacta, AtScale etc.) from HDFS files\\n6+ years of hands on experience on IT support role (L3 support) to fix platform or data related issues\\n6+ experience with Unix/Linux/Java scripting\\n5+ years of experience with new user on boarding to a database system (create and define user class, RSAM & AD roles, host group etc.)\\nStrong SQL query writing skills\\nKnowledge of standard methodologies, concepts, best practices, and procedures within Big Data environment\\nExperience with data architecture and data modeling\\nFamiliarity with Data Visualization tools like Tableau/QlikView\\nExperience working in large complex data environment\\nGood communication and presentation skills\\n\\nAdditional Information:\\n\\no Candidate should be aware of big data platform- Hortonworks, Cloudera, Mapr- doesn’t matter- good 2-3 years of experience in Big data and some experience with the big data consumption\\no Self-service tools, so the business users will be developing data transformation logic.\\no This individual will be more supporting the platform JPIS- with the infrastructure team; performance testing/tuning. Creating different user groups- work with DTI partners. Not really any development.\\no Cloudera and Hortonworks are the top two; no MapR today, but if we have good candidates in that space that is ok. Not an admin of the platform.

As both a trading firm and a tech firm, we have room for people who love to trade, people who love to program, and people everywhere in between.

(Glassdoor est.) | About the Position\n\n\nAt Jane Street, we consider trading and programming to be two ends of a continuum. As both a trading firm and a tech firm, we have room for people who love to trade, people who love to program, and people everywhere in between. Nearly all of our traders write code, and many of our developers trade. The role you carve out for yourself will be largely dependent on your strengths and the types of problems you enjoy thinking about.\n\nResearchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of the trading and software developer roles, this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.\n\nAbout You\nBe able to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems. Asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers.\nWrite great code. We mostly write in OCaml, so you should want to learn functional programming if you don't already have experience with it.\nHave good taste in research.The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers. You should be comfortable pushing in new and unknown directions while maintaining clarity of purpose.\nThink and communicate precisely and openly. We believe great solutions come from the interaction between diverse groups of people across the firm.

(Glassdoor est.) & About the Position\n\n\nAt Jane Street, we consider trading and programming to be two ends of a continuum. As both a trading firm and a tech firm, we have room for people who love to trade, people who love to program, and people everywhere in between. Nearly all of our traders write code, and many of our developers trade. The role you carve out for yourself will be largely dependent on your strengths and the types of problems you enjoy thinking about.\n\nResearchers at Jane Street are responsible for building models, strategies, and systems that price and trade a variety of financial instruments. As a mix of the trading and software developer roles, this work involves many things: analyzing large datasets, building and testing models, creating new trading strategies, and writing the code that implements them.\n\nAbout You\nBe able to apply logical and mathematical thinking to all kinds of problems. Asking great questions is more important than knowing all the answers.\nWrite great code. We mostly write in OCaml, so you should want to learn functional programming if you don't already have experience with it.\nHave good taste in research.The problems we work on rarely have clean, definitive answers. You should be comfortable pushing in new and unknown directions while maintaining clarity of purpose.\nThink and communicate precisely and openly. We believe great solutions come from the interaction between diverse groups of people across the firm.
